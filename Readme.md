Oxford Brookes HoloCare provides a proof of concept implementation of a holographic character for assessment and guidance on lifestyle management through various stages of cancer treatment using connective technology. Although there is robust evidence that exercise improves rehabilitation post surgery, most cancer survivors are not meeting the recommended physical activity guidelines of 150min per week. HoloCare seeks to change that by putting a holographic assistant into your chosen workout room, who will first assess you to then recommend (and actually demonstrate!) exercises to you.

Versions: HoloCare was built for Unity 2018.2.4f1 and HoloToolkit 2017.4.3.0, thus requiring Windows SDK 10.0.17134, Visual Studio 2017, Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (or later).
